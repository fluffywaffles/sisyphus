- Clean-up the code
  - Verisimilitude should be readable
  - Sisyphus core should be readable
- Handle prototypes correctly
  - Recursive `eq` on Object.getPrototypeOf
- Split verisimilitude and assertions, generally, from core library
- Split out the reporter(s)
- Revisit (and hopefully simplify) 'stateful' reporter
