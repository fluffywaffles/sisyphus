# Sisyphus
## make no easy mistakes
An alarmingly decent testing framework in less than 500 LOC.

Code, test, fail, repeat. Like rolling a boulder up a hill.

Test suites...
- Are arrays of assertions
- Can be written in your modules
- Don't have a crazy DSL
- Run in browsers
- Output wherever you want, and look pretty (devtools, for starters)

Tests...
- Are written with eq and refeq
- That's it
- Seriously
- What did you want

Also, on a philosophical note...
- Don't write tests for your types (write types for your types)
- Don't write tests for your tests (write tests for your code)
- Never write a test instead of an assertion (make guarantees!)
