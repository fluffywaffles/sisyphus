/* Invisible method interceptors.
 *
 * By attaching a piece of private state to an object (using the
 * `interceptor state` symbol defined above), we are able to invisibly,
 * statefully, intercept every argument pack to an arbitrary-arity curried
 * function method, intercept the result, and intercept every continuation
 * of the curried method; we can inspect and replace any of these; and we
 * can at any time install a new receiver by returning it from the current
 * receiver, allowing us to dynamically select new receivers in response
 * to messages, or build up closure state in the receiver. Finally, the
 * last-invoked receiver and the original target object can be retrieved
 * by 'releasing' the intercepted object, and the current message-receiver
 * can be replaced externally by invoking `set_receiver`.
 *
 * It's therefore possible to:
 *
 * 1. Intercept the methods of an object
 * 2. 'Release' the object and retrieve the receiver
 * 3. Continue to use the receiver elsewhere
 * 4. 'Set' the receiver back on the intercepted object
 *
 * In other words: the same receiver can be used across potentially many
 * intercepted objects, across function boundaries and call stacks,
 * tracking across client code and library code, with abandon. You can
 * intercept usage in a client, return to the library, remove or replace
 * the interceptor, etc., etc.
 *
 * You can instrument everything. Let's start with tests.
