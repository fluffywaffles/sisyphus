Why are testing frameworks so complicated?

mocha: look at all those shimmed-in globals
chai: where is the kitchen sink?
expect.js: bdd is... talkative
karma: what doesn't it do? it says "simple" and then it isn't
jasmine: is this... mocha and chai again?
buster: what's a "focus rocket"? also: unmaintained
jest: requires... webpack? how do i put this in my browser?
tape: pretty good! but node-only
node-tap: also node-only
ava: very node-only
qunit: not bad! but we can make it simpler.

I think a testing framework doesn't need to do very much. It has two parts: a testing library, and a
test runner. It should work in browsers and node without changing its setup. Here's all I want:

The testing library should provide:

- 2 types of test:
  - t.eq: deep equality checking, equivalent to refeq except for objects and arrays
  - t.refeq: regular equality for primitives; referential equality for objects and arrays
- Small conveniences:
  - t.ok: check for `true`; shorthand for t.refeq(expr)(true)

And the runner should:

Create a harness you can pass around to define your tests. The harness offers:

- 1 unit of organization:
  - t.suite('suite description', t => ...)
- 1 way to get your results:
  - t.results

And a suite of tests? Is just an array of checks. If a check returns true, it succeeds. Otherwise,
it fails. That's all there is to it.

In simple form:

```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import runner     from '@sisyphus/sisyphus'

const harness = runner({ assertions })

harness.suite(`true is true`, [
  t => t.ok(true),
])
```

The goal here is to make things simple. "Simple" doesn't mean "less code." "Simple" means that
everything is clear and makes sense. Here's what happens in the above code:

1. Import some assertions
2. Import the test runner
3. Create a harness out of the runner and assertions
4. Define tests on the harness

That's it. It's all there in the code. If you want to know what assertions are defined, then look at
the assertions library. The harness should only ever define one method, `suite`, which is used for
defining suites of tests. These are run immediately, and their output is streamed to `console` by
default. If you want to get a buffered listing of your tests and their results, just check
`harness.results`.

Test results are both streamed and buffered for summarization. If you don't want the stream, you can
just set the streaming reporter to a no-op. If you don't want to use the buffer at the end, then
don't.

```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import runner     from '@sisyphus/sisyphus'

function noop () {}
const harness = runner({ assertions }, { stream: noop })

harness.suite(`true is true`, t => [
  _ => t.ok(true),
])

// Assuming you've written a summarize(...) function:
summarize(harness.results)
```

What about exceptions? Well, import some new test methods for them.
```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import exceptions from '@sisyphus/contretemps'
import runner     from '@sispyhus/sisyphus'

const harness = runner({ assertions, exceptions })

// Now there's a `t.expect(...)`
harness.suite(`oh no`, t => [
  _ => t.expect(_ => { throw new Error('boom') })
])
```

No big deal. Oh, problem? You want to test Error subclasses? You can't. JavaScript doesn't really
allow error subclasses. However, if you like, you can test the message.

```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import exceptions from '@sisyphus/contretemps'
import runner     from '@sispyhus/sisyphus'

const harness = runner({ assertions, exceptions })

const booms = _ => { throw new Error('boom') }

// Just a little utility for grabbing the error.
const nab = throws => { try { throws() } catch (e) { return e } }

// The full test suite.
harness.suite(`oh no`, t => [
  _ => t.expect(booms),
  _ => t.eq('boom')(nab(booms).message)
])
```

There. Didn't even need another import!

Suppose you want something fancy from your assertions, like diffs. Then... return them. From the
assertion. Just return a Boolean object with additonal information on it. The harness will use
`valueOf` on all results to ensure that Booleans are treated like boolean primitives. So, you can
write something like so:

```
import _assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'

const diff = /* some diff algorithm; don't ask me */
const assertions = {
  eq: a => b => {
    return Object.defineProperty(new Boolean(_assertions.eq(a)(b)), 'diff', { value: diff(a)(b) })
  }
}

import runner from '@sisyphus/sisyphus'
const harness = runner({ assertions })

harness.suite(`what's the difference?`, t => [
  _ => t.eq('hello')('hey'),
])

harness.results.map(({ diff }) => console.log(diff)) // ta-da
```

Hey, hey, hey! Now you've got diffs.

Now let's do something really crazy. Let's add browser automation!

```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import browser    from '@sisyphus/reckless'
import runner     from '@sisyphus/sisyphus'

const harness = runner({ assertions, browser })

// Tiny utility for testing that some dom is centered at a coordinate.
const centered_at = ([ x, y ]) => dom => {
  const rect = dom.getBoundingClientRect()
  return x === (rect.x + rect.width  / 2)
      && y === (rect.y + rect.height / 2)
}

harness.suite(`click on a thing`, t => [
  _ => {
    const browser = t.browser()
    browser.click(thing.position.xy)
    const my_click_menu = browser.$(`#my-click-menu`)
    return my_click_menu.classList.contains(`open`)
        && centered_at(thing.position.xy)(my_click_menu)
  }
])
```

Whoa. Fancy. So what does `reckless` support? Name a UI event. It supports it. Just make an event
you'd like to see happen, and `reckless` will crash -- I mean, `reckless` will *drive* -- the
browser to perform it.

Do you want to test things that aren't in the DOM? Too bad. You can't test pop-up windows, confirms,
alerts, console messages, the built-in rightclick menu, or `<select>` dropdowns. (That last one is
fun: `<select>` dropdowns are legitimately not part of the DOM. So... figure that one out.)

If you want to test those things, use Selenium or something.

Want to test something to do with the other stuff in the DOM API? Like `window` or `document` or
whatever? Well you're in luck, because those things aren't part of `reckless` at all! If you're
using `reckless`, then your tests must already be running in a browser. Just use `window` and
`document`. You probably want to refresh the page between tests to clear up any DOM changes that
have occurred and start with a clean state. Don't worry: sisyphus persists your testing progress to
LocalStorage or IndexedDB or something. After the refresh, you'll pick up right where you left off.

You can easily write your tests inside your modules, too. Just export a function that takes the
sisyphus test harness as its argument:

```
import assertions from '@sisyphus/verisimilitude'
import runner     from '@sisyphus/sisyphus'

const harness = runner({ assertions })

import my_module from 'my-module'

my_module.test(harness)
```
